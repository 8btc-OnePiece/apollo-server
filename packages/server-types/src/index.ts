// Temporary index file for AS4 `@apollo/server-types`. This package will be
// renamed to `@apollo/server-types` and the API will be checked to ensure it
// contains only types needed to build plugins and other extensions (not
// internal functionality of AS).

// These are the types that used to live in `apollo-server-plugin-base`.
