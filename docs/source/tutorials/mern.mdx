title: Teaching the MERN stack to speak GraphQL
---

Apollo Server is designed to work seamlessly with the components of a MERN stack and can be easily added to your existing project. This tutorial helps you:

- Run an instance of Apollo Server that lets you execute GraphQL operations
- Expose a GraphQL route in your MERN Stack

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the command line and JavaScript and have installed a recent Node.js (v14.16.0+) version. Additionally, you have an existing MERN stack or have completed the [MERN Stack tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial) and have a `records` collection created in a `sample_training` db with the `name`, `position` and `level`columns

## Step 1: Install dependencies

In your server folder, run the following command to install these packages and save them in
your server project's `node_modules` directory:

```bash
  npm install @apollo/server @apollo/subgraph graphql graphql-tag
```

## Step 2: Define your GraphQL schema

Every GraphQL server (including Apollo Server) uses a schema to define the structure of data that clients can query. In this example, we'll create a schema for the example in the prerequisite tutorial:

Create a `schema.graphql` file and paste in the schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  record(id:ID!): Record
  records: [Record]
}

type Mutation {
  createRecord(name: String!, position: String, level: String): Record
  deleteRecord(id: ID!): Boolean
  updateRecord(id: ID! name: String, position: String, level: String): Record
}

type Record {
  id: ID
  name: String
  position: String
  level: String
}
```

## Step 3: Define the resolvers

The resolvers are where you're going to connect the GraphQL schema and your MongoDB instance.

Create a new `resolvers.ts` file and connect the resolvers to your MongoDB connection (similar to the code in the `record` route):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import db from "./db/conn.ts";

const resolvers = {
  Record: {
    id: (parent) => parent.id ?? parent._id,
  },
  Query: {
    async record(_, { id }, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      let query = { _id: new ObjectId(id) };

      return await collection.findOne(query);
    },
    async records(_, __, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const records = await collection.find({}).toArray();
      return records;
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    async createRecord(_, { name, position, level }, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const insert = await collection.insertOne({ name, position, level });
      if (insert.acknowledged)
        return { name, position, level, id: insert.insertedId };
      return null;
    },
    async updateRecord(_, args, context) {
      const id = new ObjectId(args.id);
      let query = { _id: new ObjectId(id) };
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const update = await collection.updateOne(
        query,
        { $set: { ...args } }
      );

      if (update.acknowledged)
        return await collection.findOne(query);

      return null;
    },
    async deleteRecord(_, { id }, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const dbDelete = await collection.deleteOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) });
      return dbDelete.acknowledged && dbDelete.deletedCount == 1 ? true : false;
    },
  },
};

export default resolvers;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Step 4: Add Apollo Server to your express server

In your `mern/server/server.ts` (or wherever you instantiate your `express` server), import `@apollo/server` and the `expressMiddleware`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import express, { json } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import "./loadEnvironment.mjs";
import records from "./routes/record.mjs";
//highlight-start
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph';
import { expressMiddleware } from '@apollo/server/express4';
import resolvers from "./resolvers.mjs";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
//highlight-end

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5050;
const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

//highlight-start
const typeDefs = gql(
    readFileSync("schema.graphql", {
      encoding: "utf-8",
    })
  );

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});
// Note you must call `start()` on the `ApolloServer`
// instance before passing the instance to `expressMiddleware`
await server.start();
//highlight-end

app.use("/record", records);

// start the Express server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Step 5: Add the /graphql route to your server API endpoints

In the same server file, add the `/graphql` route:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
app.use("/record", records);
// Specify the path where we'd like to mount our server
//highlight-start
app.use(
  '/graphql',
  cors(),
  json(),
  expressMiddleware(server),
);
//highlight-end

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Step 6: Start the server

We're ready to start our server! Run the following from your project's server
directory:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 8: Execute your first query

We can now execute GraphQL queries on our server. To execute our first query, we can use [**Apollo Sandbox**](/graphos/explorer/sandbox/).

Visit your MERN server in your browser at the `/graphql` route, which will open the Apollo Sandbox:

<img class="screenshot" src="./images/sandbox.jpeg" alt="Apollo Sandbox" />

The Sandbox UI includes:

- An Operations panel for writing and executing queries (in the middle)
- A Response panel for viewing query results (on the right)
- Tabs for schema exploration, search, and settings (on the left)
- A URL bar for connecting to other GraphQL servers (in the upper left)

Our server supports querying the `records`, so  let's execute it!

Here's a GraphQL **query string** for executing the `records` query:

```graphql
query GetRecords {
  records {
    name
    position
    level
  }
}
```

## Complete example

## Next steps


Congrats on completing the tutorial! Incorporating a GraphQL server into your MERN application marks a pivotal step towards creating more efficient, flexible, and user-centric web experiences.

And while this tutorial only covers the server portion of the MERN stack, the `/client` folder in the completed example picks up where we left off and implements `@apollo/client` to interact with the server.

For more information on implementing the Apollo Client, head over to our [getting started docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started).

Now that Apollo Server is integrated into your MERN stack application, you can use [GraphOS](/graphos/) to build and scale even faster.
