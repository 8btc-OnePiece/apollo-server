title: Teaching the MERN stack to speak GraphQL
---

Apollo Server is designed to work seamlessly with MERN stack components. This tutorial shows how to add Apollo Server to an existing MERN stack project. Specifically, this tutorial demonstrates how to:

- Run an Apollo Server instance that lets you execute GraphQL operations
- Expose a GraphQL route in a MERN stack application

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you're familiar with the command line and JavaScript. Additionally, it requires the following:
- You've installed a recent Node.js version (v14.16.0+).
- You've completed MongoDB's [MERN stack tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial) or have your own existing MERN stack application.
    - The tutorial's code examples build off the tutorial, but you can adapt them to your application's requirements.
- You have a MongoDB database with a `records` collection with `name`, `position`, and `level` columns.
    - The tutorial's code examples use these column names, but you can adapt them to your database's schema.

## Step 1: Install dependencies

In your server folder, run the following command to install these packages and save them in
your server project's `node_modules` directory:

```bash
  npm install @apollo/server @apollo/subgraph graphql graphql-tag
```

## Step 2: Define your GraphQL schema

Every GraphQL server (including Apollo Server) uses a schema to define the data clients can query. The following example creates a schema for the prerequisite tutorial's `records` collection:

In your server's `/src` folder, create a `schema.graphql` file and paste in the following schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  record(id:ID!): Record
  records: [Record]
}

type Mutation {
  createRecord(name: String!, position: String, level: String): Record
  deleteRecord(id: ID!): Boolean
  updateRecord(id: ID! name: String, position: String, level: String): Record
}

type Record {
  id: ID
  name: String
  position: String
  level: String
}
```
This schema lets you perform various actions on records: fetching single or multiple records, creating new records, updating existing records, and deleting records. For more information on schema definition, check out the [schema basics](../schema/schema/) docs.
## Step 3: Define the resolvers

Resolver functions are responsible for performing the actions defined in the schemaâ€”for example, fetching and updating records. In a MERN stack application, they're how you connect the GraphQL schema to your MongoDB instance.

Create a new `resolvers.ts` file and connect the resolvers to your MongoDB connection (similar to the code in the `record` route):

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import db from "./db/conn.ts";

const resolvers = {
  Record: {
    id: (parent) => parent.id ?? parent._id,
  },
  Query: {
    async record(_, { id }, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      let query = { _id: new ObjectId(id) };

      return await collection.findOne(query);
    },
    async records(_, __, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const records = await collection.find({}).toArray();
      return records;
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    async createRecord(_, { name, position, level }, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const insert = await collection.insertOne({ name, position, level });
      if (insert.acknowledged)
        return { name, position, level, id: insert.insertedId };
      return null;
    },
    async updateRecord(_, args, context) {
      const id = new ObjectId(args.id);
      let query = { _id: new ObjectId(id) };
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const update = await collection.updateOne(
        query,
        { $set: { ...args } }
      );

      if (update.acknowledged)
        return await collection.findOne(query);

      return null;
    },
    async deleteRecord(_, { id }, context) {
      let collection = await db.collection("records");
      const dbDelete = await collection.deleteOne({ _id: new ObjectId(id) });
      return dbDelete.acknowledged && dbDelete.deletedCount == 1 ? true : false;
    },
  },
};

export default resolvers;
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Step 4: Add Apollo Server to your express server

In your `mern/server/server.ts` (or wherever you instantiate your `express` server), import `@apollo/server` and the `expressMiddleware`:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
import express, { json } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import "./loadEnvironment.mjs";
import records from "./routes/record.mjs";
//highlight-start
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { buildSubgraphSchema } from '@apollo/subgraph';
import { expressMiddleware } from '@apollo/server/express4';
import resolvers from "./resolvers.mjs";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
//highlight-end

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5050;
const app = express();

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

//highlight-start
const typeDefs = gql(
    readFileSync("schema.graphql", {
      encoding: "utf-8",
    })
  );

const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema: buildSubgraphSchema({ typeDefs, resolvers }),
});
// Note you must call `start()` on the `ApolloServer`
// instance before passing the instance to `expressMiddleware`
await server.start();
//highlight-end

app.use("/record", records);

// start the Express server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Step 5: Add the /graphql route to your server API endpoints

In the same server file, add the `/graphql` route:

<MultiCodeBlock>

```ts
app.use("/record", records);
// Specify the path where we'd like to mount our server
//highlight-start
app.use(
  '/graphql',
  cors(),
  json(),
  expressMiddleware(server),
);
//highlight-end

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${PORT}`);
});
```

</MultiCodeBlock>

## Step 6: Start the server

We're ready to start our server! Run the following from your project's server
directory:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 8: Execute your first query

We can now execute GraphQL queries on our server. To execute our first query, we can use [**Apollo Sandbox**](/graphos/explorer/sandbox/).

Visit your MERN server in your browser at the `/graphql` route, which will open the Apollo Sandbox:

<img class="screenshot" src="./images/sandbox.jpeg" alt="Apollo Sandbox" />

The Sandbox UI includes:

- An Operations panel for writing and executing queries (in the middle)
- A Response panel for viewing query results (on the right)
- Tabs for schema exploration, search, and settings (on the left)
- A URL bar for connecting to other GraphQL servers (in the upper left)

Our server supports querying the `records`, so  let's execute it!

Here's a GraphQL **query string** for executing the `records` query:

```graphql
query GetRecords {
  records {
    name
    position
    level
  }
}
```

## Complete example

## Next steps


Congrats on completing the tutorial! Incorporating a GraphQL server into your MERN application marks a pivotal step towards creating more efficient, flexible, and user-centric web experiences.

And while this tutorial only covers the server portion of the MERN stack, the `/client` folder in the completed example picks up where we left off and implements `@apollo/client` to interact with the server.

For more information on implementing the Apollo Client, head over to our [getting started docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started).

Now that Apollo Server is integrated into your MERN stack application, you can use [GraphOS](/graphos/) to build and scale even faster.
